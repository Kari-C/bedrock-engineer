Use the application stored in the `dist` directory.

## ✨ Features

### Agent Chat

The autonomous AI agent capable of development assists your development process. It provides functionality similar to AI assistants like [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline), but with its own UI that doesn't depend on editors like VS Code. This enables richer diagramming and interactive experiences in Bedrock Engineer's agent chat feature. Additionally, with agent customization capabilities, you can utilize agents for use cases beyond development.

## Customize Agents

Click the ⚙️ icon in the top right to customize agent settings. Enter the agent's name, description, and system prompt. The system prompt is a crucial element that determines the agent's behavior. By clearly defining the agent's purpose, regulations, role, and when to use available tools, you can obtain more appropriate responses.

## Customize Tools

The executeCommand tool allows you to register commands that can be executed in the CLI. Unregistered commands cannot be executed. You can extend the agent's capabilities by registering commands that connect to databases, execute APIs, or call other AI agents.

### Website Generator

Generate and preview website source code in real-time. Currently supports the following libraries, and you can interactively generate code by providing additional instructions:

- React.js (w/ Typescript)
- Vue.js (w/ Typescript)
- Svelte.js
- Vanilla.js

Here are examples of screens generated by the Website Generator:

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
  <div style="width: 45%; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
    <img src="./assets/website-generator.png" alt="website-generator">
    <span>House Plant E-commerce Site</span>
  </div>
  <div style="width: 45%; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
    <img src="./assets/website-generator-data-visualization.png" alt="website-generator">
    <span>Data Visualization</span>
  </div>
  <div style="width: 45%; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
    <img src="./assets/website-generator-healthcare.png" alt="website-generator">
    <span>Healthcare Blog</span>
  </div>
</div>

The following styles are also supported as presets:

- Inline styling
- Tailwind.css
- Material UI (React mode only)

#### Connect to Design System Data Source

By connecting to Amazon Bedrock's Knowledge Base, you can generate websites referencing any design system, project source code, or website styles.

You need to store source code and crawled web pages in the knowledge base in advance. When registering source code in the knowledge base, it is recommended to convert it into a format that LLM can easily understand using methods such as [gpt-repository-loader](https://github.com/mpoon/gpt-repository-loader). Figma design files can be referenced by registering HTML and CSS exported versions to the Knowledge Base.

Click the "Connect" button at the bottom of the screen and enter your knowledge base ID.
