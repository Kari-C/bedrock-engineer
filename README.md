or

```
npm run build:win
```

or

```
npm run build:linux
```

Use the application stored in the `dist` directory.

## ✨ Features

### Agent Chat

The autonomous AI agent capable of development assists your development process. It provides functionality similar to AI assistants like [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline), but with its own UI that doesn't depend on editors like VS Code. This enables richer diagramming and interactive experiences in Bedrock Engineer's agent chat feature. Additionally, with agent customization capabilities, you can utilize agents for use cases beyond development.

- 💬 Interactive chat interface with human-like Amazon Nova, Claude 3.5, and Meta llama models
- 📁 File system operations (create folders, files, read/write files)
- 🔍 Web search capabilities using Tavily API
- 🏗️ Project structure creation and management
- 🧐 Code analysis and improvement suggestions
- 📝 Code generation and execution
- 📊 Data analysis and visualization
- 💡 Agent customization and management

## Select an Agent

Choose an agent from the menu in the top left. By default, it includes a Software Developer specialized in general software development, a Programming Mentor that assists with programming learning, and a Product Designer that supports the conceptual stage of services and products.

## Customize Agents

Click the ⚙️ icon in the top right to customize agent settings. Enter the agent's name, description, and system prompt. The system prompt is a crucial element that determines the agent's behavior. By clearly defining the agent's purpose, regulations, role, and when to use available tools, you can obtain more appropriate responses.

## Select Tools / Customize Tools

Click the Tools icon in the bottom left to select the tools available to the agent. Refer to [this page](./src/preload/tools/tools.ts) for each tool's role.

The executeCommand tool allows you to register commands that can be executed in the CLI. Unregistered commands cannot be executed. You can extend the agent's capabilities by registering commands that connect to databases, execute APIs, or call other AI agents.

### Website Generator

Generate and preview website source code in real-time. Currently supports the following libraries, and you can interactively generate code by providing additional instructions:

- React.js (w/ Typescript)
- Vue.js (w/ Typescript)
- Svelte.js
- Vanilla.js

Here are examples of screens generated by the Website Generator:

|          House Plant E-commerce Site           |                           Data Visualization                           |                           Healthcare Blog                            |

The following styles are also supported as presets:

- Inline styling
- Tailwind.css
- Material UI (React mode only)

#### Connect to Design System Data Source

By connecting to Amazon Bedrock's Knowledge Base, you can generate websites referencing any design system, project source code, or website styles.

You need to store source code and crawled web pages in the knowledge base in advance. When registering source code in the knowledge base, it is recommended to convert it into a format that LLM can easily understand using methods such as [gpt-repository-loader](https://github.com/mpoon/gpt-repository-loader). Figma design files can be referenced by registering HTML and CSS exported versions to the Knowledge Base.

Click the "Connect" button at the bottom of the screen and enter your knowledge base ID.
